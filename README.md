# TechLegendsTrivia
Tech Legends Trivia is an Android application designed to test users' knowledge about famous personalities in the technology sector. The app presents a series of questions, each with four possible answers, and the user must select the correct one. This project is currently a work in progress and demonstrates my learning journey in Android development using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and various other modern Android development tools.

✔ **Project Structure**: Improved understanding of effective project organization and structuring.

# To-Do
* **Code Review**: Ensure the existing code is correct and logical.
* **Refine Dependency Injection**: Identify and fix issues in the Hilt implementation.
* **Score Functionality**: Implement a system to track and display user scores.
* **Question Counter**: Add functionality to count and display question progress.
* **Skip and Help Features**: Develop 'Skip' and 'Help' functionalities with proper game mechanics.
* **Alert Dialogs**: Implement dialogs for limits reached and game end scenarios.
* **Testing**: Conduct unit and UI tests for application reliability.
* **App Icon**: Design and add a distinct app icon.
* **Fix Known Issues**: such as image scaling in answer cards and correct level selection mechanism to not trigger new questions.
